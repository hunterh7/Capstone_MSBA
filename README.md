Swire Predictive Maintenance: Break-even Analysis Project
Project Overview
Business Problem and Project Objective
Swire faces a critical challenge in optimizing maintenance processes to minimize equipment downtime and operational costs. Predictive maintenance offers a potential solution by anticipating failures before they occur.

The objective of this project was to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of predictive maintenance by conducting a break-even analysis and exploring predictive models to quantify cost savings. Through this dual approach, we aimed to provide actionable insights for Swire's decision-making process.

Group's Solution to the Problem
Our group pursued two complementary approaches to address Swire's business problem:

Break-even Analysis
This analysis identified the financial tipping point where the costs of implementing predictive maintenance were offset by the savings from reduced equipment downtime and failures. The analysis included cost inputs such as maintenance costs, failure costs, and implementation costs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Model Development

EDA provided critical insights into the data, revealing trends and patterns that informed the break-even analysis.
While initial predictive models were attempted, limitations in data quality and time constraints meant that these efforts were less fruitful.
Ultimately, the break-even analysis provided the most actionable results, offering a clear financial justification for Swire to invest in predictive maintenance.

My Contribution
Key Roles
Break-even Analysis Idea
I proposed the break-even analysis as a practical framework for addressing the business problem.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I conducted the majority of the projectâ€™s EDA, uncovering key patterns and trends in Swire's data. These insights informed the parameters and assumptions used in the break-even analysis.
Collaboration
While I did not code the break-even analysis directly, I worked closely with the team member responsible for its implementation, ensuring that our EDA findings were accurately integrated.
Team Dynamics
During periods of disagreement within the group, I helped mediate discussions to keep the project on track and ensure alignment with the overall objective.
Business Value of the Solution
The break-even analysis delivered immediate business value by demonstrating the financial feasibility of predictive maintenance. It quantified the savings Swire could achieve by reducing unplanned downtime, providing a solid foundation for investment decisions.

Although the predictive modeling efforts did not yield usable results, they contributed to the project by clarifying data limitations and highlighting areas for improvement in future iterations.

Challenges Encountered
Our team faced several significant challenges during the project:

Group Dynamics
Misaligned priorities and personality conflicts caused delays in the early stages. While some members focused on coding and modeling, others concentrated on financial analysis, leading to a lack of cohesion.

Data and Technical Issues
The available data was incomplete and noisy, which limited the effectiveness of predictive modeling. Additionally, time constraints prevented us from refining these models.

Resource Allocation
Diverging approaches to problem-solving resulted in uneven allocation of effort across the team.

Despite these challenges, the group ultimately delivered a meaningful solution by leveraging the strengths of individual contributions.

Lessons Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:

The Importance of EDA
Exploratory data analysis is a critical step in any data-driven project. It provides the foundation for all subsequent analyses and decisions.

Practicality Over Perfection
In business contexts, practical and actionable solutions, such as the break-even analysis, often deliver more immediate value than complex but incomplete models.

Team Collaboration
Effective teamwork requires clear communication, role alignment, and mutual respect. Navigating group conflicts taught me how to mediate and keep projects moving forward.

Difficulties and Reflection
Difficulties
Balancing the diverse perspectives and priorities of the group was a recurring challenge. Additionally, the data limitations exposed gaps in our initial assumptions and forced us to pivot our approach multiple times.

Reflection
This project underscored the importance of flexibility and problem-solving in the face of unexpected challenges. By focusing on practical outcomes, we were able to deliver meaningful results despite the obstacles.
